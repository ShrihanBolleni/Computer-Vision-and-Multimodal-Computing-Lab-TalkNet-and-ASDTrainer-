# Computer Vision and Multimodal Computing Lab - TalkNet & ASDTrainer

This repository contains projects from the CVMC Lab focused on speech analysis and autism detection:

## Projects

### TalkNet
- A speech analysis tool for real-time transcription and feedback.
- Uses deep learning models for speech-to-text conversion.
- Can be integrated with other multimodal AI applications.

### ASDTrainer
- A machine learning tool designed to aid in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection.
- Utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze behavioral cues.
- Includes multimodal data processing for improved prediction accuracy.

## Features
- Real-time processing for both speech and visual input.
- Modular architecture to easily extend or integrate with other projects.
- Supports training and evaluation with custom datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
